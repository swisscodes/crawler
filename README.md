i have setup this project with manuel testing on the fontend
would like to run some test and also do some refactoring but that would be if
i had enough time more than 6 hours and also i try to submit this test before weekend

currently my design related decisions is related to me being new to using puppeteer although its
very easy to use with a very good documentation but i just had to follow the easy way for the test

to be honest it took me a little bit more than 6 hours but thats just all about getting to know puppeeteer
given more hours i beleive i can then refactore and debug and test for almost every edge cases
and probably move the all code to a class based which i can then use Promises to fine tune all the so many
await keywords in the code.

also i tried not to use react but it just seem a little more work to setup using babbel or pure js
so just to be able to show somethings on the frontend i use react.

thank you for the oppurtunity.
